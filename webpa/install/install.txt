Installation Guide
------------------

*  Edit the includes/inc_global.php file in the includes directory to configure the application; in particular:
     - APP__WWW: URL to the instance of WebPA (without a closing "/");
     - DOC__ROOT: directory path to the WebPA files (with a closing "/" or "\\");
     - database settings:
        - APP__DB_HOST: host name
        - APP__DB_USERNAME: username
        - APP__DB_PASSWORD: password
        - APP__DB_DATABASE: database name
        - APP__DB_TABLE_PREFIX: table prefix (default is "pa2_" which means that the new version can share the same database as the old version if required)
     - configure the LDAP settings if you wish to authenticate via LDAP.
     
*  Run the following scripts to initialise the database (edit the files to change the names and password as required):
     - install/webpa2_database.sql: create the database schema and user account;
     - install/webpa2_tables.sql: create the database tables;
     - install/webpa2_administrator.sql: create an administrator account and sample module.

		 - navigate to root of WebPA application;
		 - enter a username of "admin" and a password of "admin"
		 - change the password to something more secure after logging in
		 
*  Delete the "install" folder when you're finished.
